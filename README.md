# aerogear-ios

Thank you for landing here!

 We have decided to deprecate aerogear-ios development and focus all our efforts in bringing the same feature-set (and  more) in a new modular set of libraries that utilize [Swift programming language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) as their base.  Already a small but important feature set of libraries has been implemented. See the following repositories for more information on each respective library.

- [aerogear-ios-http](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-http)
- [aerogear-ios-oauth2](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-oauth2)
- [aerogear-ios-httpstub](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-httpstub)

If you are looking for the previous versions of aerogear-ios,  you might want to have a look at this [branch](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios/tree/1.6.x). Note that no further development is done on this branch apart from any critical bug fixes.

Enjoy!
