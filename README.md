# aerogear-ios

Thank you for landing here!

 We have decided to deprecate aerogear-ios development and focus all our efforts in bringing the same feature-set (and  more) in a new modular set of libraries that utilize [Swift programming language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) as their base.  Already a small but important feature set of libraries has been implemented. See the following repositories for more information on each respective library.

aerogear-ios '_umbrella release 2.0_'

- [aerogear-ios-http v0.1](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-http/tree/0.1)
- [aerogear-ios-oauth2 v0.1 ](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-oauth2/tree/0.1)
- [aerogear-ios-httpstub v0.1](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-httpstub/tree/0.1)
- [aerogear-ios-cookbook v0.1](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-cookbook/tree/0.1)
- [aerogear-backend-cookbook v0.1](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-backend-cookbook/tree/ios_2.0)
- [aerogear-ios-push v2.0](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-push/tree/2.0)


If you are looking for the previous versions of aerogear-ios,  you might want to have a look at this [branch](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios/tree/1.6.x). Note that no further development is done on this branch apart from any critical bug fixes.

Enjoy!
